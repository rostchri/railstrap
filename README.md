# Railstrap Rails Gem

## What is this?

## Integration in your Rails project: 
	Gemfile:	gem 'railstrap'
	application.js: //= require bootstrap  (use bootstrap)
	application.js: //= require kickstrap  (use kickstrap)

	application.css: *= require bootstrap  (use simple bootstrap)
	application.css: *= require kickstrap  (use kickstrap)

## Requirements:
  Bootstrap and kickstrap needs less. So following lines in Gemfile are needed:
  gem 'less-rails'
	gem 'therubyracer', :platform => :ruby
## Example:
